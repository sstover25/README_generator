# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

```
The README.md generator was created to ease the process of creating a README.md file for future projects. It accepts information about the project, including the title, description, licenses, etc., and then it compiles all of that information into a README template.
```

## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
- It is done when the user is prompted for information about their application repository, including but not limited to description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. After answering all prompts, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. All answered prompt information is then also populated in the appropriate sections.

- It is done when after a user enters their project title, it displays as the title of the README.

- It is done when the user chooses a license for the application from a list of options and then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

- It is done when the user enters their GitHub username and it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

- It is done when the user enters their email address and it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach the user with additional questions.

- It is done when a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents and is taken to the corresponding section of the README.
